## Folder structure
- `index.html`
- `assets/img/page_01.jpg` ... `page_18.jpg`

## Replace images
Replace the placeholder JPGs in `assets/img/` with your real hamper poster images.
**Keep the filenames exactly the same** (case-sensitive) so iPhone Safari and GitHub Pages will load them correctly.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo, upload everything in this folder.
2. Repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / `(root)`.
3. Open the Pages URL.
